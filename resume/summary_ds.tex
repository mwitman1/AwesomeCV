I am interested in applying my data science skills to solve problems and make new discoveries at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and machine learning. These are skills that I have developed and applied to computational materials science research throughout my PhD and previous work experiences. I thrive working in a team environment and have proactively collaborated with researchers at many different institutions around the world to complete challenging projects.
